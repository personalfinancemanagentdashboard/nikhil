Build a complete full-stack web application called “SmartFinance.AI — AI-Powered Personal Finance Dashboard with Voice Assistant.”

🎯 Goal

Create a modern, secure, and interactive finance management platform that helps users track expenses, income, budgets, and goals, while using AI & voice interaction to make personal finance easier and smarter.

🧱 Tech Stack

Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS

Backend: Flask (Python) or FastAPI

Database: SQLite (local) or MongoDB Atlas (cloud)

Charts: Chart.js or Recharts

AI Assistant: OpenAI GPT API (via openai or langchain)

Voice Assistant: Web Speech API (browser speech-to-text & text-to-speech)

Hosting: Replit (for development) → Vercel/Render (for deployment)

⚙️ Core Functional Requirements
1. User Authentication

Login/Signup with JWT or Flask-Session.

Encrypt passwords with bcrypt.

Optional: Google OAuth integration.

2. Dashboard Overview

Show cards for:

Total Income

Total Expenses

Savings Balance

Financial Health Score

Display monthly insights & graphs (Bar/Pie/Line charts).

3. Transaction Management

Add, Edit, Delete transactions.

Categorize: Food, Rent, Bills, Entertainment, Transport, etc.

Auto-categorize using keywords (e.g., “Zomato” → Food).

Import .csv (bank statement).

4. Budget & Goal Management

Set monthly budgets.

Alert when 80% of a category’s budget is reached.

Create savings goals (“Buy a laptop – ₹80,000”) with progress bars.

5. AI Financial Assistant

Chat interface connected to OpenAI GPT API.

Query user data using natural language:

“What was my highest expense last month?”

“How much did I spend on food this year?”

“Give me saving tips for this month.”

Use backend endpoint /ai/query that fetches data from DB and prompts GPT.

6. Voice Assistant

Use Web Speech API for browser voice recognition & speech synthesis.

Voice commands examples:

“Add ₹500 expense for groceries.”

“Show my savings for October.”

“What is my top spending category?”

Responses should be both shown in text and spoken aloud.

7. AI Insights

Generate insights using Python (pandas):

“Your travel expenses increased by 20% this month.”

“You saved ₹5,000 more than your 3-month average.”

Automatically compute financial health score:

score = (savings_ratio * 40) + (budget_adherence * 30) + (goal_progress * 30)

8. Bill Reminders

Users can add upcoming bills with due dates.

Highlight in dashboard when due in <5 days.

Optional: Email alert via SMTP.

9. Reports

Export reports as PDF or Excel.

Filter by date, category, or amount.

10. Dark/Light Mode

Add a toggle for theme (store preference in local storage).

🧠 Advanced & Bonus Features

Smart Forecasting – Predict next month’s spending using regression on past data.

Gamified Goals – Add badges like “Saved 3 months in a row!”

Receipt OCR – Upload a receipt → extract text → auto-add expense (using pytesseract).
